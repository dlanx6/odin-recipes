    <p>
        Sinigang is a classic Filipino soup characterized by its sour and savory medley of flavors. It's popular comfort food in the Philippines, usually served on its own or paired with steamed rice on rainy days to ward off the cold.

    <p>
        Like adobo, the term sinigang describes a cooking method more than a particular dish, as it has many variations. It can be made with protein such as pork, fish, shrimp, beef, and chicken and souring agents such as tamarind, guava, green mango, calamansi, kamias, batuan, santol, and other native fruits.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Rinse pork ribs and drain well.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a pot over medium heat, combine pork and enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, skimming scum that accumulates on top.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once broth clears, add tomatoes, onion, and fish sauce. Lower heat and simmer for about 1 to 1 ½ hours or until meat is tender, adding more water as necessary to maintain about 8 cups.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add gabi and cook for about 4 to 6 minutes or until tender.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add chili peppers and radish. Continue to simmer for about 2 to 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add long beans. Continue to cook for about 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add eggplant and okra and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            If using packaged tamarind base, add to the pot and stir until completely dissolved.
        </li>
        <li>
            Season with salt and pepper to taste.
        </li>
    </ol>
