    <p>
        In Filipino cuisine, adobo refers to a common and indigenous cooking method. In the late 16th century, the Spanish referred to it as adobo due to its superficial similarity.

        The main ingredients of Philippine adobo are ingredients native to Southeast Asia, namely vinegar, soy sauce or fish sauce, peppercorns, garlic, and bay leaves. It does not traditionally use chilis, paprika, oregano, or tomatoes. Rather, adobo is characteristically salty and sour, and often sweet taste. Another version is cooking it with coconut milk.
